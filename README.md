# INF 653 VC Midterm Project
## This project uses the MVC model to implement a small used car lot's inventory. There are files for the admin and users. The user will be able to browse the listings, while the admin may edit the listings by adding or removing vehicles, makes, types, and classes. With my program, the user may search with all three criteria and sort by price or by year. 
## [Update 1] Added the functionality to register a name for the cookies assignment. I also reorganized the files to better fit the MVC pattern. 
## [Update 2] Added the functionality to login as an admin and register new admin user. Couldn't get some of the files to work correctly, so I had to make it work in a non-secure way. Aside from that, the only bug is that the user can logout and click the back button and return to a version of the admin site.
